Presents the info quite clearly it does state version infor later on but I just didnt want to hit you with a wall of output. The webserver didnt give anything away even after using dirbuster. Letsee what I can find out about the Oracle service. To look for oracle nmap scripts I used the following:

<pre>[<span style="color: #8ae234;"><b>root</b></span>:<span style="color: #cc0000;">~/Desktop/silo</span>]# locate .nse | grep oracle                                                                                                                                                  (<span style="color: #fce94f;"><b>master</b></span><span style="color: #ef2929;"><b>âœ±</b></span>)

</pre>

I tried to run oracle-tns-version.nse but it didnt work for some reason &#8211; it just gave me a default nmap scan. Instead I ran the following:

<pre>[<span style="color: #8ae234;"><b>root</b></span>:<span style="color: #cc0000;">~/Desktop/silo</span>]# nmap -p 1521 -A 10.10.10.82                                                                                                                                                (<span style="color: #fce94f;"><b>master</b></span><span style="color: #ef2929;"><b>âœ±</b></span>)

I&#8217;ve highlighted the version number in green. OK good, now lets see what else I can find out from the nmap scripts

So we have an sid ( whatever that is )

It looks as if the script ran &#8211; but I&#8217;m not 100% as it hasn&#8217;t given me an indication of users.

I was getting a bit frustrated here so I fireup Metasploit, looked for modules and ran a few. I found this:

<pre><u>msf</u> auxiliary(<span style="color: #ef2929;"><b>scanner/oracle/tnspoison_checker</b></span>) &gt; run

I have to admit I had to check the hackthebox forums for hints at this point. Someone people were saying to install odat <https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat> and it was not easy to install. I gave up. ODAT (Oracle Database Attacking Tool) is an open source penetration testing tool that tests the security of Oracle Databases remotely. Why is this not installed in Kali by default!? I can&#8217;t be bothered registering with oracle to download the tool then run complicated configuration commands. FU Silo, Oracle and Kali. Only joking Kali I cant stay mad at you.
