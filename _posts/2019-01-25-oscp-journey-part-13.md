We&#8217;ll I&#8217;m back in the labs after a few months off. I took a good 2 months off hacking and the last month I subscribed to <a href="http://virtualhackinglabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="virtualhackinglabs.com (opens in a new tab)">virtualhackinglabs.com</a> for one month. Their PDF is very good.

In my time off I have been improving my notes [guide.offsecnewbie.com.](http:// guide.offsecnewbie.com) I did a few hackthebox machines and worked on <a href="https://guide.offsecnewbie.com/kali-configuration/terminator-shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="customising my terminal (opens in a new tab)">customising my terminal</a> to make some things easier.

In my previous attempt I skimmed over the exercises. This time I&#8217;m ensuring I do them all and understand them &#8211; as best I can. 

I put off the Buffer Overflow exercises last time as I couldn&#8217;t get my head around it. This time &#8211; as of last night I completed the SLmail and the VulnServer exercises! Very chuffed with myself! I took a day off work and put in about 12 hours to make notes on it and complete the exercises. 

Reading over the notes I had taken for the boxes that I had rooted has revealed that my notes are terrible! If I was to submit a lab report or exam report the way I had taken notes I would have not have passed! An important lesson learned there.
