So have been working away at hackthebox machines for about 9 months now and thoroughly enjoying them. They really have allowed me to build up my skill set and the people there are polite and funny. I&#8217;m pleased to say I&#8217;ve graduated from Noob to Script Kiddie and currently 50% of the way to Hackthebox Hacker status (there still are quite a few levels higher).

When I started, I had an Off Sec Chrome bookmark with about 5 sites. Now that bookmark takes some time to scroll through. Its amazing the amount of great info there is out there. I really should sort them but I kinda know where things are now so I might just leave it. I sometimes wish I was Jonny Five&#8230;INPUT&#8230;.INPUT instead of a &#8216;rowbot&#8217; that requires a 28k modem to assimilate information and even then, has constant disconnections.

I&#8217;m about to start the infamous OSCP, signed up for 3 months and have been toying with the idea of having regular blogs throughout it, more for me to look back at my mind set and what I was struggling with, let me know what you think. I am excited and apprehensive. I have come to the conclusion that the more you know the more you realize how much you don&#8217;t know! Especially watching Ippsec and r00k&#8217;s Youtube Videos. Highly recommended.

I&#8217;m anticipating a real kick in the stomach when they bombard me with PDFs and videos. But as this blog states Offensive Security is a journey and no journey can be started without the first step. What I&#8217;ve now come to accept is that OSCP is only the first step&#8230;.but f**k me its a big one.
