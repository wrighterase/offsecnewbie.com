I feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of information I have to learn, the number of machines that there are on the lab network, the number of open ports on a lot of the machines, the length of time it takes to run nmap scans. I finished the buffer overflow videos and my brain started to melt. I haven&#8217;t started the buffer overflow exercises yet.

I have to say I am used to tackling 1 box at a time with HacktheBox. I&#8217;m a bit like a rabbit caught in the headlights. There are so many avenues to go down, I think it&#8217;s just a case of me picking one and going down it. I&#8217;m spending a lot of time customizing my scans and using different tools to see what I can find out &#8211; essentially trying to build a solid process.

Some of the exercises are difficult and some to my annoyance don&#8217;t work very well using the VM they gave you. There are workarounds provided if you dig them out in the forum but it&#8217;s just a pain.

I think I&#8217;m just tired as I&#8217;ve already put in a lot of hours &#8211; going to bed between 1.30am and 2.30am each night, up early in the morning for work + up sometimes a few times during the night feeding my 5 month old kid.

I think I need to root a box to get me feeling better about things.
