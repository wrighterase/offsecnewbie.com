Just a short update as I haven&#8217;t posted anything for a while.

Have been feeling quite down of late and starting to think is this something that is just out of my technical reach. I&#8217;m not making any progress and seem to be stuck. I have taken about a week off as I just can&#8217;t get my head round the Buffer Overflow section. The PDF and the Video covers this far to quickly for my liking.

That&#8217;s not the only thing that&#8217;s frustrating me. The lab network is full of older machines which I know can be easily exploited using Metasploit I have been trying to exploit the vulnerability the manual way but I&#8217;m having no joy. Just on that, the PDF does cover Metasploit &#8211; why? I&#8217;m not sure as it can&#8217;t be used in the exam.

I am slowly going through the exercises, some of which I&#8217;ve already done. I know that most people would have finished them within the first 3 weeks &#8211; I haven&#8217;t been as productive and am still working through it. It just seems to be taking me longer than most.
