T minus 30 days and panic mode has set in. The exam is in less than 4 weeks and I&#8217;m not ready for it &#8211; clearly. I wont pass the exam on this attempt but I&#8217;m still going to do it for the XP. 

I&#8217;m getting better at finding the vulnerabilities but taking advantage of them is still taking too long. There&#8217;s a lot still to learn but can see the progress from when I started.

For those that have experienced the lab i&#8217;ll say that BETHANY broke me! I had to step away for about a week as the priv esc on that box was difficult. What added to the difficulty was the tool I was using to echo the powershell script up to the box wasn&#8217;t working correctly &#8211; and this wasn&#8217;t apparent to me. So I was uploading lines with missing characters or spaces in the wrong place. Anyway I managed to upload a file another way and got it working. Also the echo up tool is fixed &#8211; phew. [www.Pentest.ws](http://www.Pentest.ws) &#8211; check it out, really useful for payload creation as well. 

Time has been a major factor for me, I&#8217;m just not putting in the required time. So make sure you&#8217;ve absolutely nothing planned for 3 months when doing this cert. I&#8217;ve have had too many things from preventing me to get hours in the lab. Real life gets in the way! Not to worry, these things happen and I&#8217;ll just keep doing what I can do. 

P.s. keep working at HTB as I&#8217;ve spotted a few machines in the lab that are very similar!
