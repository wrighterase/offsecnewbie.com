Well I&#8217;ve just finished the exam and unsurprisingly I&#8217;ve failed. I didn&#8217;t exploit a single box. 

Now for the excuses:

The main one is my lack of knowledge &#8211; simply down to the fact that I needed to put in more time that I could. Now no doubt some people would be able to pass with the time I put in but not me &#8211; thus the title of this site, I&#8217;m very much a newb. 

I was working late on the labs two nights before the exam, the night before I got to bed at a reasonable time but got essentially no sleep. A random event occured, cows from two fields across broke into my garden and wrecked the place! I tried to chase them but they were having none of it. I was equiped to deal with dirty cow exploits but not real cows! Then during my exam I had to find out who owned them and then had the farmers coming round and trying not to accept blame and not wanting to pay for damages. I now have a &#8220;garden&#8221; full of crap and piss! Looks like the BBQ this weekend is cancelled.

With all that going on perhaps my mind wasn&#8217;t in the right place. Saying that I have to be realistic &#8211; I would not have passed anyway, but I&#8217;d like to think I would have got into a box or two.

This attempt allowed me to get experience of the exam so when I&#8217;m in a position to pass (knowledge wise) I will know what to expect. 

I had made a plan which I stuck to and it made me feel as if I had quite a lot of time and good amount of breaks. [OSCP exam plan](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AoBJLD90xdyFg6pJr88YtfR-Q5XjMQ). Let me know if you use it any find it useful.

So my exam was a proctored exam and I found it fine on average, about 15 minutes before your starting time you connect to:  
<https://screenconnect.offensive-security.com:8040/>  
to share your screen  
<https://webcam.offensive-security.com/>  
to view you and do a room scan  
You also have to show your ID and compare that to your face.  
  
The only issue I had was I bought a webcam from Amazon Logitech C270 HD Webcam and it was terrible at viewing text &#8211; I spent about 30 minutes trying to get it to focus on my ID. In the end I had to get my laptop and use its webcam to focus on it. Make sure you test this before your exam.

What&#8217;s next?  
When I first purchased lab access I paid for two 3 month access. So before I start my second stint in the labs I&#8217;m gonna take a break for a month maybe two. In slow time I&#8217;m going to go through and spruce up my exercises report format. 

I&#8217;ll tackle a couple of hack the box machines and maybe a vulnhub machine.

If you have passed let me know your secret.

I will achieve this certification I don&#8217;t care how many resits it takes.
