  This is not meant as a detailed walk-through, more of a reference guide of

# Intro

## You can use the search tool at the top right corner of the page

Check out [Pentest.ws](https://pentest.ws/features) a tool I rely on so much to help speed up my workflow when attacking HTB or OSCP machines.

Thanks to guif, g0tmi1k, fuzzysecurity, practical hacking, xapax and all other sites I've used to allow me to collate this document.
